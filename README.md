The COMSOL simulation datasets are in the directory named **PLOS_ONE_natural_convection_in_cytoplasm_data_2024_ND_WL_EL_vf**.

The MATLAB scripts and functions used to generate the results for the axisymmetric system (bi-spherical coordinates), are in the directory named **PLOS_ONE_natural_convection_in_cytoplasm_codes_2024_ND_WL_EL_vf**.

The description for the datasets and the code can be found in the file named <a href="https://github.com/nikhiId/cyto-convection/blob/main/description_of_data_and_code.pdf" target="_blank">**description_of_data_and_code.pdf**</a>.
